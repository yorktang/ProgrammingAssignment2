## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", which is really a list containing a function to
## set the value of the vector
## get the value of the vector
## set the value of the inversed matrix
## get the value of the inversed matrix


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getsolve <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setsolve = setsolve,
       getsolve = getsolve)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getsolve()
  if(!is.null(m)){
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setsolve(m)
  m
}
